# Minecraft Quiz (Phaser.js Final Project)

This is my final project for my Javascript class. It's a Minecraft-themed quiz made using Phaser.js where you guess which crafting recipe matches the item shown.

The idea came from me playing Minecraft and wanting to make something simple but fun. You get three hearts, and each wrong answer takes one away. Once you're out of lives or finish all questions, the game ends and shows your score.

## Features

- Multiple quiz questions with randomized answer options
- Clickable crafting recipes to choose your answer
- Lives system with heart icons
- Start screen and Game Over screen
- Click sound effects
- Fully themed around Minecraft style
